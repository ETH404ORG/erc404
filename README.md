# ERC404

ERC-404 is a new experimental way of combining two existing standards in the cryptocurrency world: ERC-20 and ERC-721. It aims to allow for both regular token transactions (like ERC-20) and unique, non-fungible tokens (like ERC-721) to work together smoothly.

To make this work, ERC-404 uses a method called "pathing." Pathing is a bit like fitting two things into one space by overlapping them. It's not perfect, but it tries to make sure everything fits without causing major problems.

If other systems want to work with ERC-404, they need to make sure they understand and follow these overlapping rules.

This version of ERC-404 tries to solve common problems and make it easier for different systems to work together. But because it's still new and hasn't been fully checked by experts, there might be issues that need to be fixed.

Overall, ERC-404 is an experiment that tries to combine two different cryptocurrency standards in a way that makes sense.
